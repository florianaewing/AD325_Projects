These three projects document my experiences in Data Structures and Algorithms, where I learned how to manage datasets in VS Code using a combination of techniques to find emergent patterns in data, build basic UI's, and implemented a number of searching algorithms according to the optimum time and space complexity required for each job. Each project is listed in full within an individual jupyter notebook, while the code can also be found in the .py files where they underwent unit testing. For more information, read the project report, available in each project within a file named "report.txt."
