This project was interesting, I was initially very curious to find out the 
status of Peter Parker's blood pressure. My hope is that on the next project we get to 
work with MORE data at once, since the sample sets of real data so far have been pretty
small. I have a feeling we'll eventually get to that anyway though. Kindof a headache	
getting Graphviz to work, but it seems like a useful tool from the python software library
that I will certainly be using again.
