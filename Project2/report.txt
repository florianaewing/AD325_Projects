I chose the Recommendation System Program for a number of reasons. Number one, I am not interesting in generating fake data.
Working with real data is much more satisfying and aligns with the goals of the data scientist.
Two, I really enjoy videogames. I don't have time to play them anymore, and when I do, it isn't so easy to enjoy them as it used to be.
I still haven't figured this out yet, but seeing all the names brought back a satisfying sense of nostalgia. 
This program was fun to write, and it was interesting to consider the merits of one collision avoidance technique over another. 
As its name suggests, quadratic probing was a much less efficient technique, taking more time and causing a much larger number of collisions. 
Separate chaining was always much much faster and nearly eliminated any chance of causing a collision. 
I hope you can still find the time to play videogames every day! I am hoping that someday soon I can reintroduce myself to the joy that they used to bring me.
